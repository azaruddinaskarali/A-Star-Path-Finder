#   A* path finding algorithm

I have implemented the A* search algorithm using python. I have built  a path finding visualizer tool to visualize the a star pathfinding algorithm as it runs. This A* pathfinding algorithm is an informed search algorithm which means it is much more efficient that your standard algorithms like breadth first search or depth first search.

A* Path Finding algorithm is written in Python using PyGame.

#  Features

1.Left-click to select a node which will represent the starting node


2.Right-click (shift + left-click) to select a node which will represent the ending node


3.Press 'space' to let the algorithm find the shortest path between the two nodes


4.Shortest path will be highlighted in Purple.


5.Press 'c' to clear the path and resume clicking on nodes


6.If no path is possible, no path is highlighted and a message appears on the top of the window
